    <p>Welcome to the teachers section of our guide! In this section Teachers who are interested in becoming
    a succesful teacher and learn how to become a good one!</p>
    <h1>Teacher life in the classroom</h1>
    <p>Teachers in the SEP Program are as new to the program as any teacher curious in participating
    which means that any new teacher coming into the program won't be
    very behind and having to study late nights to catch up.
    Sometimes during our presentation or code alongs we even surprise our
    teacher with a line of code that they did not know and it's clear that they don't have
    a mastery over it yet, giving new teachers more confidence that they are not behind
    but eventually you will have to go out of your "comfort zone"
    and into the "panic zone" or "learning zone" to teach new material to the
    students in your class.</p>
    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
    <h4>This part will give curious teachers resources and tips on how to become
    a successful teacher in the SEP program</h4>

<h3>Do live coding and ask for student's advice for the next steps</h3>
    <h1>Code alongs</h1>
    <p>Code alongs mean that the teacher will create
    incomplete works of code and code based on their judgement 
    but will also take in opinions from the students watching along.
     It is a great way to teach coding to new students
      and a great way to learn from the students as well since
      they might know of a shortcut or more efficient way of fixing the code.</p>
